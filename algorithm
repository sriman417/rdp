Consider a path of different points. Keep the start and end points of the path.
Now draw the doted lines from the points to the line segment.
Now find the furthest distance from the starting point.
Consider epsilon which is near to the furthest point.
If the furthest point is greater than the epsilon from the line segment then the point must be kept.
Then the process finds the recursive path from the first point and the furthest point and then with the furthest point and the last point.
After the completion of the process a new curve with few points will be generated.
